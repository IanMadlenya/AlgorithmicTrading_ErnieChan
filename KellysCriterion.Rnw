\section{Background}
I remember having read ``Fortune's formula'' 5 years back and I don't remember a thing why Kelly's criterion is used. I have spent the last two days going over Kelly Criterion. My immersion in math has given me skillset to understand Thorpe paper. I spent 6 to 8 hrs on Thrope's paper after which reading non-math content became easy and pleasant. This document will summarize my learnings from Thorpe's paper, some general notes on the web about Kelly criterion and chapters from Ernie chan's book.

\section{Edward Thorpe's paper on Kelly Criterion}

\href{http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall12/papers/Thorpe_KellyCriterion2007.pdf}{Edward Thorpe}, \emph{The Kelly Criterion in Blackjack,Sportbetting and Stock market}, 1997.

\subsection{Introduction}

How much of capital must be invested on various profitable opportunities ? There were several approaches considered in the past. One approach is to choose a goal, such as to minimize the probability of total loss within a specified number of trials, N. Another example would be to maximize the probability of reaching a fixed goal on or before N trials.A different approach, much studied by economists and others, is to value money using a utility function.Thorpe was introduced to Kelly criterion by Shannon in 1960. Kellys criterion was a bet on each trial so as to maximize $E(\log X)$ where $X$ is the wealth of the investor.


\subsection{Coin tossing}


Imagine odds are in our favor in a coin tossing contest $p > q$ and we come across an infinitely wealthy opponent. We want to decide how much we must bet each game ? If our initial
capital is $X_0$
\[
X_k = X_{k-1} + T_k B_k
\] where $T_k = \pm 1$, depending on the outcome and $B_k$ is the amount bet.

The expected value of the wealth after $n$ steps is 
\[
E(X_n)  = X_0 + \sum^n_{k=1} E(B_k T_k) = X_0 + (p-q) \sum^n_{k=1} E(B_k) 
\]
Hence the above strategy suggests \textit{bet everything} but the probability of eventual ruin is 1. Hence this \textit{bold strategy} is often undesirable.
Using a timid strategy by taking minimum bet on each trial, also minimizes expected gain. Hence \textit{timid strategy} is also no good. This suggests an intermediate
strategy, somewhere between maximizing $E(X_n)$ and minimizing $E(X_n)$.A midway approach is the Kelly's Criterion based on logarithmic utility. One strategy is to bet a fraction $f$ of your bankroll.
\[
B_i = f X_i
\]
Hence ``ruin'' in the technical sense cannot happen.
Let $G_n(f)$ represent the exponential rate of increase of capital per trial and
$g(f)$ represent the expected value of the same. 
\[
G_n(f) = \log \left [ {X_n \over X_0} \right ]^{1/n}
\]
and 
\[
g(f) = E \left \lbrace {S \over n} \log (1+f) + {F \over n} \log (1-f) \right \rbrace
\]

Differentiating the above one gets the optimal fraction for bettings as $p-q$.
For the graph we have $g(0)=1$, $g(1^-) = -\infty$, $g(f_c)=0$, for some $f_c$ and $g(f)$ takes the max value, for some $f^\ast$, 
\begin{compactitem}
\item $0 <f < f^\ast$ guarantees a no ruin game
\item $f = f^\ast$ gives the maximum growth rate
\item $0 < f < f^{\ast}$ or $f^{\ast} < f < f_c$ guarantees win but with slower rate of growth
\item $f > f_c$ means a ruin
\end{compactitem}


\begin{theorem}
\begin{compactenum}
\item If $g(f) > 0$, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = \infty, a.s$
\item If $g(f) < 0$, then $\lim_{n \to \infty} X_n = 0, a.s$
\item If $g(f) = 0$, then $\lim \sup_{n \to \infty} X_n = \infty, a.s$ , $\lim \inf_{n \to \infty} X_n = 0, a.s$
\item Given a strategy $\phi^\ast$, which maximizes $E \log X_n$ and any other strategy $\phi$,
then 
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} {X_n(\phi^\ast) \over X_n(\phi)} = \infty, a.s
\]
\item The expected time for the current capital $X_n$ to reach any preassigned goal $C$, 
is asymptotically least with a strategy that maximized $E(X_n)$.
\item Suppose the return on bet $U_i$ is a binomial random variable with probability of success $p_i, 1/2 < p_i < 1$, then $E(X_n)$ is maximized by choosing on each trial, the fraction $p_i - q_i$ which maximized $E(\log 1 + f_i U_i)$
\end{compactenum}
\end{theorem}



\textbf{\textsc{Example 1}}
Player A plays against an infinitely wealthy adversary. Player A wins
even money on successive independent flips of a biased coin with a win probability of
$p = .53$ (no ties). Player A has an initial capital of $X_0$ and capital is infinitely divisible
<<tidy=TRUE>>=
p <- 0.53
q <- 1-p
(f.star <- p-q)
fun <- function (fc) {return(p*log(1+fc) + q*log(1-fc))}
(f.c <- uniroot(fun, interval =c(0.01,0.99))$root)
@

\begin{compactitem}
\item If the player bets a fraction larger than \Sexpr{f.star*100}\% up to $f_c$, $X_n$ will slowly edge towards $\infty$.
\item If the player bets a fraction smaller than \Sexpr{f.star*100}\%, $X_n$ will slowly edge towards $\infty$.
\item If the player bets a fraction larger than \Sexpr{round(f.c,2)*100}\% , $X_n$ will eventually hit $0$
\item After $n$ successive bets, the player's bank roll reaches \Sexpr{fun(f.star)}n, then the time to double the money is
<<>>=
(round(log(2)/fun(f.star)))
@
\end{compactitem}

The Kelly criterion can easily be extended to uneven payoff games. Suppose Player A wins $b$ units for every unit wager. Further, suppose that on each trial the win probability is $p > 0$ and $pb âˆ’q > 0$ so the game is advantageous to Player A, 
the optimal fraction of capital is 
\[
f^{\ast} = {bp-q \over b}
\]


\subsection{Optimal growth: Kelly criterion formulas for practitioners}
This section compares Kelly criterion with other fixed fraction strategies

\subsection{The probability of reaching a fixed goal on or before n trials}

The paper talks about the most useful single fact for dealing with diverse problems in gambling and in the theory of financial
derivatives.
\[
P (\sup [X(t) - (at+b)] \geq 0,  0 \leq t \leq T) = \mathcal N(-\alpha - \beta) + e^{-2ab} \mathcal N(\alpha - \beta)
\] where $\alpha = a \sqrt{T}$ and $\beta = b /\sqrt{T}$

Let $f$ be the fraction bet. Assume iid trials $Y_i, i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, 
with $P(Y_i = 1) = p >1/2 , P(Y_i = -1) = q < 1/2$. Let $V_k$ be the value of the gambler after k trials. 
\begin{align*}
P(V_k \geq C , 1 \leq k \leq n) &=
P(X_t \geq \log C - mt/s^2 , 1 \leq t \leq s^2 n) \\
&=
\mathcal N(-\alpha - \beta) + e^{-2ab} \mathcal N(\alpha - \beta)
\end{align*}
with 
\begin{align*}
T &= s^2 n \\
b &= \log C \\
a &= -m/s^2 \\
\alpha &= -m \sqrt{n}/s \\
\beta &= \log C /(s \sqrt{n})
\end{align*}

\subsection{The probability of ever being reduced to a fraction x of this initial bankroll}

To address this problem , the probability turns out to 
\[
Prob(\cdot) = e^{2ab}, \quad a = -m/s^2, b = -\log x
\]

<<>>=
frac.strategy.2 <- function(f,x){
  p      <- 0.51
  q      <- 1-p
  mu     <- function(x){ p*log(1+x) + q*log(1-x) }
  sd2    <- function(x){ p*q*log( (1+x)/(1-x) )^2 }
  m      <- mu(f)
  s2     <- sd2(f)
  b      <- -log(x)
  a      <- -m/s2
  exp(2*a*b)
}
frac.strategy.2(0.02,0.3)
@
For the limiting continuous approximation and the Kelly optimal fraction
\[
P(V_k(f^\ast) \leq x  , k \geq 1) = x
\]
Most cautious gamblers or investors who use Kelly
find the frequency of substantial bankroll reduction to be uncomfortably large. We can see why now. To reduce this, they tend to prefer somewhat less than the full betting fraction

\subsection{The probability of being at or above a specified value at the end of a specified number of trials}

\[
P(X(T) \geq aT +b) = \mathcal N(-\alpha -\beta)
\]

<<>>=
frac.strategy.3 <- function(f){
  C      <- 2
  n      <- 10^4
  p      <- 0.51

  alpha  <- a*sqrt(T)
  beta   <- b/sqrt(T)
  pnorm(-alpha-beta) 
}

@

\subsection{Continuous approximation of expected time to reach a goal}

\[
n(C,f) = {\log C \over g(f)}
\]

\subsection{Comparing fixed fraction strategies: the probability that one strategy leads another after $n$ trials}
One can compute the expected value and the variance for rate of increase of capital per trial

\begin{align*}
G(f) &= (W_n/n) \log(1+f) +(1 - W_n)/n \log(1-f) \\
E(G(f)) &= p \log(1+f) +q \log(1-f) \\
Var(G(f)) &= {pq\over n} \left \lbrace \log \left({1+f \over 1-f} \right)^2 \right \rbrace
\end{align*}

Hence using the above moments, one can compare the strategies in two cases,one where the players are using two different fractions on the same trial, and second case is where the betting is on iid trials. 

\vskip .1in
One can compare the Kelly strategy with other fixed fractions to determine the probability that Kelly leads after $n$ trials. Note that this probability is always greater than 0.5 because 
$g(f^{\ast}) - g(f) > 0$ where $f^{\ast} = p - q, f \neq f^{\ast}$. But some small values of $n$ this might not be the case. So, when does Kelly start to dominate ?

It is important to understand that ``the long run",the time it takes for $f^{\ast}$
dominate a specified neighbor by a specified probability, can vary without limit. Each
application requires a separate analysis. The paper gives an example where dominanace if slow.

\subsection{Blackjack}
The analysis is more complicated than that of coin tossing because the payoffs are not simply one
to one. In particular the variance is generally more than 1 and the Kelly fraction tends
to be less than for coin tossing with the same expectation. Moreover, the distribution
of various payoffs depends on the player advantage. 

The betting in blackjack has a lot of nuances. The author take a simple example where the player must make small ``waiting" bets on the unfavorable situations in order to be able to exploit the favorable situations. On these he will place ``large" bets.
There are two cases considered. 
\vskip .1in
\textsc{Case 1:} Bet $f_0$ on unfavorable situations and find the optimal $f^{\ast}$ for favorable situations. In this case the solution is the old kelly criterion $p-q$. Since the sidebets are fixed quantity, there is no influence of it on the optimal bet fraction via Kelly.

\vskip .1in
\textsc{Case 2:} Bet $f$ in favorable situations and $af, 0 < a < 1 $ in unfavorable situations. As $a$ increases from 0 to 1, the Kelly fraction decreases from $p-q$ to 0. Thus the Kelyy fraction for favorable situations is less in this case when bets on unfavorable situations
reduce the overall advantage of the game.

\subsection{Sports betting}
Thorp introduces multiple betting situation via sports betting examples. The section starts off with an example of betting on two independent favorable coins with betting fractions $f_1$ and $f_2$.
\[
g(f_1,f_2) = p_1 p_2 \log (1+f_1 +f_2) + p_1 q_2 \log (1+f_1 -f_2) +
p_2 q_1 \log (1-f_1 +f_2) +q_1 q_2 \log (1-f_1 -f_2) 
\]
Optimizing the above expectation, one gets
\begin{align*}
f^\ast_1 &= {m_1(1-m_2^2) \over 1 - m_1^2 m_2^2} \\
f^\ast_2 &= {m_2(1-m_1^2) \over 1 - m_1^2 m_2^2} 
\end{align*}
where $m_1$ and $m_2$ ideal kelly fractions, i.e. $m_i = p_i - q_i$. This shows that the fractions in this case are reduced in the case iid simulatenous bettings.

The first glimpse of using kelly comes in the form of a question, 
\begin{quote}
Our simultaneous sports bets were generally on different games and typically not
numerous so they were approximately independent and the appropriate fractions were
only moderately less than the corresponding single bet fractions. Question: Is this always
true for independent simultaneous bets? Simultaneous bets on blackjack hands at
different tables are independent but at the same table they have a pairwise correlation
that has been estimated at 0.5. This should substantially reduce
the Kelly fraction per hand. The blackjack literature discusses approximations to these
problems. On the other hand, correlations between the returns on securities can range
from nearly -1 to nearly 1. An extreme correlation often can be exploited to great
advantage through the techniques of ``hedging". The risk averse investor may be able
to acquire combinations of securities where the expectations add and the risks tend to
cancel. The optimal betting fraction may be very large.
\end{quote}

This means one might have to take covariance structure between trials while betting. Using a simple coin toss example, Thorp shows that Kelly criterion going increases as the correlation of outcomes in two trials become negative.

\subsection{Wall street: the biggest game}
I had to plod through the first 20 pages of the paper, understand the author's arguments to give me enough preparation to go over this section. This gives the Kelly criterion applied to a security of stocks. It connects the covariance of stocks, the excess mean returns of the stocks and come up with a formula for kelly fraction for a set of stocks.

This paper is very well organized with adequate examples, solid math , intuition, practical results. Such papers are rare I guess and hence it might be worth the time and effort that goes on in reading and thinking about various aspects of the paper.


\section{Size Matters}
I stumbled on to an article  by titled \href{http://www.capatcolumbia.com/MM\%20LMCM\%20reports/Size\%20Matters.pdf}{Size Matters} and found that the paper hits on all a variety of important points relating to using this criterion.The paper has the following ideas
\begin{compactitem}
\item Not many portfolio managers have position sizing as their forte
\item Based on information theory, the Kelly Criterion says an investor should choose the investment(s) with the \textbf{highest geometric mean return}. This strategy is distinct from those based on mean/variance efficiency.
\item Kelly's fraction for discrete world is 
\[
\textbf{f} = {\textbf{Edge} \over \textbf{Odds} }
\]
A simple example illustrates the point. Assume you can participate in a coin toss game
where heads pays \$2 and tails costs \$1. You start with a \$100 bankroll and can play for
40 rounds. What betting strategy will allow you to achieve the greatest probability of the
most money at the end of the fortieth round?

@
\item Connection with Shannon's work - For Shannon, the incompressible part of a message relates to its unpredictability. The less probable a message, the more bandwidth it requires.Shannon's theory also considers equivocation -the chance the message is wrong and shows - you must subtract equivocation from the channel capacity to determine the information rate.
John Kelly, recognized another application for information theory's ideas: gambling.Information in a betting setting is something the market does not already know. Consistent with the idea of equivocation, true information is also probabilistic. Kelly imagined a system where you have an edge; a set of expectations that differs from those of the market. He then developed a formula, based on Shannon's work, showing the exact amount of your bankroll you should bet in order to maximize your capital over the long term. Consistent with the theory, the maximum rate of return comes when you know something the market doesn't.
\item via ``The Mathematics of Gambling'' : \textit{The chance of ruin is small} - Because the Kelly system is based on proportional bets,losing all of your capital is theoretically impossible (assuming money is infinitely divisible).Even so, a small chance of a significant drawdown remains.
\textit{The Kelly system is highly likely to grow a bankroll faster than other systems}. Provided comparably attractive opportunities continue to appear, there is a high probability the system will generate a bankroll that exceeds other systems by a determinable multiple.
\textit{You tend to reach a specified level of winnings in the least average time}. If you have a financial end goal in mind and continuous opportunities, the Kelly system will likely allow you to achieve the objective in a shorter time than other systems.
\item the Kelly Criterion works well when you parlay your bets, face repeated opportunities, and know what the underlying distribution looks like.
\item the central message for investors is that standard mean/variance analysis does not deal with the compounding of investments. If you seek to compound your wealth, then maximizing geometric returns should be front and center in your
thinking.
\item Problems with Practical application of Kelly
\begin{compactitem}
\item the geometric mean maximization strategy does not assure that you will end up with more wealth than other strategies. Since the approach is based on probability,
there remains a very small chance an investor will do poorly
\item success of geometric mean maximization depends on investors staying in the market for
the long run. If an investor needs access to the funds in the near term, the benefits of
compounding do not apply.
\item the system assumes the investment payoffs remain steady and the investment
opportunities set is large enough to accommodate a rising asset base. Shifting investment
payoffs undermine the system.
\end{compactitem}
\item Geometric mean maximization simply does not make sense for a portfolio manager in this short term mindset.
\item Good for closed ended funds but firms are increasing offering open ended funds
\item Loss aversion can lead investors to suboptimal decisions and sticking with Kelly is difficult for psychological reasons.
\item Mean variance is not the best way to think about maximizing long-term wealth if you are reinvesting your investment proceeds
\end{compactitem}


\section{Ernie Chan's blog post}

Ernie chan has a dedicated chapter on Kelly criterion in one of his books on quant trading. On his blog he has summarized his view about it via the blog post, \href{http://epchan.blogspot.in/2006/10/how-much-leverage-should-you-use.html}{How much leverage should you use? Maximizing growth without risking bankruptcy}. The main points from his posts and the list of comments for his post are :
\begin{compactitem}
\item Continuous version of Kelly fraction
\[
\textbf{f} = \mathbf{{m-r \over s^2}}
\]. This quantity looks like the familiar Sharpe ratio, but it is not.
\item The common recommendation is that you should halve your expected returns estimated from backtests when calculating $f$. This is often called the half-Kelly criterion.
\item Kelly criterion requires you to sell into a loss (assuming you have a long-only portfolio here), and buys into a profit â€“ something that requires steely discipline to achieve. It also runs counter to the usual mean-reversion expectation.
\item if your goal is to maximize your wealth (which equals your initial equity times the maximum growth rate possible using your strategy), Kelly criterion is the way.
\item If you adopt the Kelly criterion, there may be long periods of drawdown, highly volatile returns, low Sharpe ratio, and so forth. The only thing that Kelly guarantees (to an exponentially high degree of certainty), is that you will maximize the growth potential of your strategy in the long run, and you will not be bankrupt in the interim because of the inevitable short-term market fluctuations.
\item comments to the blog post
\begin{compactitem}
 \item The basic idea of the Kelly criterion, optimize geometric return of your portfolio, makes a lot of sense, only the optimal leverage will be substantially lower than a naive application of the Kelly criterion suggests. You can convince yourself of this if you do a Monte-Carlo simulation of differently leveraged portfolios with actual return distribution instead of Gaussian returns, periodic instead of continuous rehedging, and trading costs
\item The half factor in fractional kelly comes from collective gut feeling of quant traders
\item The reason full kelly betting isn't used is not because it's ``wrong" (i.e. lognormal vs. fat tailed, though that causes problems), but because we usually don't really know the expected return nor variance. We might be able to make good guesses, but they are still guesses. Kelly shows that overbetting leads to ruin, whereas underbetting is "merely" suboptimal.
\end{compactitem}

\section{Betting with the Kelly Criterion}
\href{http://www.math.washington.edu/~morrow/336_10/papers/jane.pdf}{This} is a brief note with a simulation exercise for using Kelly criterion. First thing that I realized from reading this write up is that, Kelly took the base 2 logarithm of capital as his utility function in his paper. Somehow my mind tricked me in assuming natural logarithm.
I just thought a simulation similar to the one done in the note.

For the random realization, the kelly criterion and an arbitrary fraction does not make any difference. In fact following Kelly criterion, the portfolio becomes quite volatile.

\section{Money and Risk Management}

Chapter 6 of the book," Quantitative Trading, How to build your own algorithmic trading business? " , deals with Kelly criterion and some backtesting results on SPY. Here are some points from the chapter

The question that this chapter answers is,"how should capital be allocated amongst a set of portfolio of strategies ?".Denoting the optimal fractions to be allocated as $F^\ast = (f_1^\ast,f_2^\ast, \ldots, f_n^\ast)^T$, Thorpe shows that the optimal allocation is 
\[
F^\ast  =C^{-1} M
\]

Here, $C$ is the covariance matrix such that matrix element $C_{ij}$ is
the covariance of the returns of the $i$tj and $j$th strategies, and 
$M = (m_1,m_2, . . . ,m_n)^T $ is the column vector of mean returns of the strategies.

If we assume that the strategies are all statisticaly independent, the covariance matrix
becomes the diagonal matrix, with the diagonal elements equal to the variance of the
individual strategies. This leads to 
\[
f_i = {m_i \over s_i^2}
\]

If there is a restriction on your maximum overall leverage
$l$, then you might have to reduce each $f_i$ by the same factor 
\[
l \over |f_1| + |f_2| +\ldots + |f_n|
\]

By adopting the abov fraction for each strategy, the long term compounded growth rate of strategy becomes
\[
g = r + S^2 /2 , \quad \text{ where } S \text{ is the Sharpe ratio of the strategy}
\]
The takeaway is that the higher the Sharpe ratio of your portfolio (or strategy), the higher the maximum growth rate of your equity (or wealth), provided you use the optimal leverage recommended by the Kelly formula.

The chapter talks about a limitation of using half-kelly :Sometimes, even taking the conservative half-Kelly formula may be too aggressive, and traders may want to limit their portfolio size further by additional constraints. This is because the application of the Kelly formula to continuous finance is premised on the assumption that return distribution is Gaussian.

The chapter is certainly gungho about Kelly,as can be inferred from this quote,
\begin{quote}
My newfound discipline and faith in the Kelly formula has so far prevented similar disasters from happening again.
\end{quote}

At the beginning of the chapter, the author borrows something from Behavioral finance that I found very interesting

\begin{quote}
research has suggested that the average human being needs to have the potential for making \$2 to compensate for the risk of losing \$1, which may explain why a Sharpe ratio of 2 is so emotionally appealing
\end{quote}


\section{Risk Management}
Chapter 8 of the book,"Algorithmic Trading Winning Strategies and Their Rationale " , deals with risk management and the author touches upon Kelly criterion.

The chapter discusses the key concept in risk management, ``prudent use of leverage". However there are times when reality forces to limit the max drawdown of an account. In such cases, stoploss or portfolio insurance can be followed. 

\subsection{Leverage}

How does one go about analyzing the leverage to be applied to a set of stocks or set of strategies ? The answer is Kellys criterion. In the author's previous book on algorithmic trading, there is a full chapter dedicated to Kelly criterion. Though it is not mathematically rigorous, the author touches upon all the important points that one need to understand about Kelly fraction. The key idea is the idea of geometrical returns and the optimal leverage to maximixe the networth is given by kelly fraction. In practice, traders follow half-Kelly to incorporate the estimation error of mean and covariances of stocks/strategies that go in to the computation of kelly fraction. Obviously there is also an error in assuming gaussian returns but for that original kelly formula by Thorpe does not given any guidance. In particular if there is a limit on leverage, which is usually the case, the author makes an important point
\begin{quote}
When we have two or more strategies with very diff erent independent growth rates, and when we have a maximum leverage constraint that is much lower than the Kelly leverage, it is often optimal to just apply all of our buying power on the strategy that has the highest growth rate.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Optimization of Expected Growth Rate using Simulated Returns}
This section deals with the situation where student $t$ distribution is used to compute the kelly fraction. There is no neat closed form after relaxing gaussian assumption. One must do it numerically. The author uses the returns from the mean reversion strategy described in one of the previous chapters in the book.
<<>>=
pathname             <- file.path(".", "/data/AUDCAD_unequal_ret.mat")
data                 <- readMat(pathname)
mu                   <- mean(data$ret)
stdev                <- sd(data$ret)
(f.star               <- (252*mu)/(sqrt(252)*stdev)^2)
@
Thus optimal kelly under gaussian is \Sexpr{round(f.star)}.
To relax the gaussian distribution, one can fit a $t$ distribution and then simulate from that distribution
<<warning=FALSE>>=
fit                  <- fitdistr(data$ret, "t")
returns.sim          <- fit$estimate[1]+ fit$estimate[2]* rt(10000,fit$estimate[3])
g                    <- function(f,R){ sum(log(1+f*R))/length(R)}
myf                  <- 0:40;
myg                  <- rep(NA,41)
for(f in seq_along(myf)){
  myg[f]           <- g(f, returns.sim)
}
(myf[which.max(myg)])
@

<<kellyf4, fig.cap="Expected Growth Rate g as Function of f.", opts.label = "fig.large">>=
plot(myf, myg, type="l",col = "blue", xlab = "f", ylab = "g",cex.lab=0.7,cex.axis=0.7)
@
By simulating via a $t$ distribution, the optimal fraction is around \Sexpr{myf[which.max(myg)]}.

\subsection{Optimization of Historical growth rate}
Instead of optimizing the expected value of the growth rate using our analytical
probability distribution of returns,one can of course just optimize the historical growth rate in the backtest with respect to the leverage.
<<warning=FALSE>>=
g                    <- function(f){ sum(log(1+f*data$ret))/length(data$ret)}
(f.hist               <- optimize(g,interval=c(1,40),maximum=TRUE)$maximum)
@
This method suffers the usual drawback of parameter optimization in backtest: data-snooping
bias. In general, the optimal leverage for this particular historical realization
of the strategy returns won't be optimal for a diff erent realization that will
occur in the future. Unlike Monte Carlo optimization, the historical returns
offer insuffi cient data to determine an optimal leverage that works well for
many realizations. Despite these caveats, brute force optimization over the backtest returns
sometimes does give a very similar answer to Kelly leverage.

\subsection{Maximum Drawdown}
In the case when a constraint of max drawdown is imposed, it is not straight forward to compute the kelly fraction. Hence one might have to do trial and error to get to the right leverage. As an input to this exercise, one can use the historical returns or the simulated returns. Each of the input has its own advantages and disadvantes. A good compromise may be a leverage somewhere in between those generated by two methods. 

\subsection{Constant Proportion Portfolio insurance}
This strategy entails applying the kelly criterion to the max drawdown $D$. The rest of the capital sits in cash. In this way, the max drawdown is adhered to by deisgn. If the trading strategy is profitable and the total account equity reaches a new high water mark, then we can reset our subaccount equity so that it is again $D$ of the total equity,
moving some cash back to the "cash" account. However, if the strategy suffers
losses, we will not transfer any cash between the cash and the trading subaccount.
Of course, if the losses continue and we lose all the equity in the trading
subaccount, we have to abandon the strategy because it has reached our
maximum allowed drawdown of $âˆ’D$. Therefore, in addition to limiting our
drawdown, this scheme serves as a graceful, principled way to wind down a
losing strategy. One problem using CPPI is that you can't precent a big drawdown happening during the overnight gap.

\subsection{Stop Loss}
If you believe in mean reverting signal, then the concept of the spread reaching a new low or new high might seem a temporary aberration. But the problem is that there could have been a regime shift in which case one has to close out the position. There is always this risk when one trades a mean reverting strategy. The author suggests a simple method of having a stop loss that is bigger than the backtest intraday drawdown.As an aside, momentum strategies benefit from stoploss.If a momentum
strategy is losing, it means that momentum has reversed, so logically we
should be exiting the position and maybe even reversing the position. Thus,
a continuously updated momentum trading signal serves as a de facto stop
loss. This is the reason momentum models do not present the same kind of
tail risk that mean-reverting models do.

Key summary points from the chapter
\begin{compactitem}
\item Maximization of long-term growth rate:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Is your goal the maximization of your net worth over the long term? If so,
consider using the half-Kelly optimal leverage.
\item Are your strategy returns fat-tailed? You may want to use Monte Carlo
simulations to optimize the growth rate instead of relying on Kellyâ€™s
formula.
\item Keeping data-snooping bias in mind, sometimes you can just directly
optimize the leverage based on your backtest returnsâ€™ compounded
growth rate.
\item Do you want to ensure that your drawdown will not exceed a preset
maximum, yet enjoy the highest possible growth rate? Use constant
proportion portfolio insurance.
\end{compactitem}


\item Stop Loss:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Stop loss will usually lower the backtest performance of mean-reverting
strategies because of survivorship bias, but it can prevent black swan
events.
\item Stop loss for mean-reverting strategies should be set so that they are
never triggered in backtests.
\item Stop loss for momentum strategies forms a natural and logical part of
such strategies.
\end{compactitem}


\item Risk indicators:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Do you want to avoid risky periods? You can consider one of these
possible leading indicators of risk: VIX, TED spread, HYG, ONN/OFF,
MXN.
\item Be careful of data-snooping bias when testing the effi cacy of leading risk
indicators.
\item Increasingly negative order fl ow of a risky asset can be a short-term
leading risk indicator
